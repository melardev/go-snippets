# Introduction
This repository contains several golang snippets I came up with over the time, some were built while
learning, some were taken from other sources and adapted. I have taken snippets(and adapted them) from 
several sources: StackOverflow, blogs, github projects, etc. that many that I prefer not to give a list.

I will keep updating this repo as more snippets are ready, I have hundreds of snippets but unfortunately
they are not ready as for now, so I did not include them, but as time goes by, they will be included.
